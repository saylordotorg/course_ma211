**Unit 3: Spectral Theory, Matrices, and Inner Product** <span
id="3"></span> 
**We have seen that matrix A corresponds to a linear transformation, T,
i.e. T(x) =Ax.  If the matrix is square, then those nonzero vectors, any
of which are transformed to a multiple of themselves, are called
eigenvectors of the matrix, and the mutliples by which they are
transformed are called eigenvalues (*eigen*is the German word for
characteristic).  The set of eigenvalues is called the spectrum of A and
plays an important role in linear algebra.  In this unit, you will study
the spectrum of a square matrix in detail.*  
  
 *The first thing that we will see is that the eigenvalues of an nxn
matrix correspond to the roots of an n<sup>th</sup> degree polynomial,
called the characteristic polynomial of A.  As you know from algebra,
roots of a polynomial can have multiplicity larger than 1.  For
eigenvalues, the multiplicity of a root is called the algebraic
multiplicity of the eigenvalue, while the dimension of the set of
vectors for which it is an eigenvalue is called the geometric
multiplicity of the eigenvalue.  If these two multiplicities are the
same for all eigenvalues, then you will see that A is similar to a
matrix with nonzero entries only along the main diagonal, that is
A=S<sup>-1</sup>DS for an invertible matrix S.  In fact, the diagonal
entries of D are the eigenvalues of A, and the columns of S are a basis
of R<sup>n</sup> consisting of eigenvectors.  Since solving polynomial
equations can be difficult, you will study methods of estimating
eigenvalues just by looking at the matrix.*  
  
 *You will then consider situations where the eigenvalues are known to
be real and the matrix S, which diagonalizes A, can take a special form.
 If the matrix A is symmetric, that is a<sub>ij</sub>=a<sub>ji</sub> 
for all i,j, then you will see that A can be diagonalized, that is, all
roots of the characteristic polynomial are real numbers.  Further, you
will learn how to choose the basis of eigenvalues, which comprise S so
that the rows and columns each are unit vectors and are mutually
perpendicular.  Such matrices are called orthogonal and have the
property that S<sup>-1</sup>=S<sup>T</sup>, where S<sup>T</sup> is the
matrix obtained from S by interchanging its rows and columns.  Since not
all square matrices are diagonalizable, you will need one of the most
important theorems in the spectral theory of matrices: Schur’s Theorem,
which is useful for analyzing the structure of matrices.*  
  
 *In linear algebra, you usually want to see whether or not Ax = b has
any solutions.  Often Ax = b has no solution because there are more
equations than unknowns, that is, the linear system is inconsistent and
b is not in the column space of A.  In this case, you can try to find an
approximation using a very important technique of the least square
approximation.  Another thing you want to do is to characterize when Ax
= b has a solution, that is, construct conditions for solvability of the
system.  One way of doing this is by using Fredholm’s Alternative, which
is discussed in this unit.  Fredholm’s Alternative is important, because
it can be generalized to more general vector spaces, where the concept
of rank of a determinant is not defined.  Finally, this unit discusses
an important result known as the singular value decomposition, which
gives a factorization of a matrix.* *
