This course is an introduction to linear algebra.  It has been argued
that linear algebra constitutes half of all mathematics.  Whether or not
everyone would agree with that, it is certainly true that practically
every modern technology relies on linear algebra to simplify the
computations required for Internet searches, 3-D animation, coordination
of safety systems, financial trading, air traffic control, and
everything in between. Linear algebra can be viewed either as the study
of linear equations or as the study of vectors.  It is tied to analytic
geometry; practically speaking, this means that almost every fact you
will learn in this course has a picture associated with it.  Learning to
connect the facts with their geometric interpretation will be very
useful for you. The book which is used in the course focuses both on the
theoretical aspects as well as the applied aspects of linear algebra. 
As a result, you will be able to learn the geometric interpretations of
many of the algebraic concepts in this subject.  Additionally, you will
learn some standard techniques in numerical linear algebra, which allow
you to deal with matrices that might show up in applications.  Toward
the end, the more abstract notions of vector spaces and linear
transformations on vector spaces will be introduced. In college algebra,
one becomes familiar with the equation of a line in two-dimensional
space: y = mx+b.  Lines can be generalized to planes and “hyperplanes”
in many-dimensional space; these objects are all described by linear
relations.  Linear transformations are ways of rotating, dilating, or
otherwise modifying the underlying space so that these linear objects
are not deformed.  Linear algebra, then, is the theory and practice of
analyzing linear relations and their behavior under linear
transformations.  According to the second interpretation listed above,
linear algebra focuses on vectors, which are mathematical objects in
many-dimensional space characterized by magnitude and direction.  You
can also think of them as a string of coordinates.  Each string may
represent the state of all the stocks traded in the DOW, the position of
a satellite, or some other piece of data with multiple components. 
Linear transformations change the magnitude and direction of
vectors—they transform the coordinates without changing their
fundamental relationships with one another.  Linear transformations are
often written in a compact and easily-readable way by using matrices.
Linear algebra may at first seem dry and difficult to visualize, but it
is one of the most useful subjects you can learn if you wish to become a
business-person, a physicist, a computer-programmer, an engineer, or a
mathematician. Remember, the prerequisite of this course is one variable
calculus course and a reasonable background in college algebra.

### Course Information

Welcome to MA211.  Below, please find general information on the course
and its requirements.  
    
 **Primary Resources: **This course is composed of a range of different
free, online materials. However, the course makes primary use of the
following materials:  

-   Kenneth Kuttler’s *[Elementary Linear
    Algebra](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/Elementary-Linear-Algebra-4-26-12-Kuttler-OTC.pdf)*

**Requirements for Completion: **In order to complete this course, you
will need to work through each unit and all of its assigned materials. 
You will also need to complete assignments for Unit 1 through Unit 6 as
well as the final exam.   
    
 Note that you will only receive an official grade on the Final Exam.
 However, in order to adequately prepare for this exam, you will need to
work through the assignments and all the reading material in the
course.  
    
 In order to “pass” this course, you will need to earn a 70% or higher
on the Final Exam.  Your score on the exam will be tabulated as soon as
you complete it.  If you do not pass the exam, you may take it again.  
    
 **Time Commitment: **This course should take you a total of **135.75
hours** to complete.  Each unit includes a “time advisory” that lists
the amount of time you are expected to spend on each subunit.  These
should help you plan your time accordingly.  It may be useful to take a
look at these time advisories and to determine how much time you have
over the next few weeks to complete each unit, and then to set goals for
yourself.  For example, Unit 1 should take you 25.5 hours.  Perhaps you
can sit down with your calendar and decide to complete all of Unit 0 (a
total of 1.25 hours) and half of subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on
Monday night; the rest of subunit 1.1 (a total of 3 hours) on Tuesday;
half of subunit 1.2 (a total of 3 hours) on Wednesday; etc.  
    
 **Tips/Suggestions:** It will likely be helpful to have a calculator on
hand for this course.  
    
 Make sure you have a solid understanding of the pre-requisite topics
outlined in Unit 0 before moving on to other units in the course.  As
you read, take careful notes on a separate sheet of paper.  Mark down
any important equations, formulas, and definitions that stand out to
you.  It will be useful to use this “cheat sheet” as a review prior to
completing the Final Exam.

### Preliminary Information

    **Elementary Linear Algebra* was written and submitted to the Open
    Textbook Challenge by Dr. Kenneth Kuttler of Brigham Young
    University.  Dr. Kuttler wrote this textbook for use by his students
    at BYU.  According to the introduction of *Elementary Linear
    Algebra*, “this is intended to be a first course in linear algebra
    for students who are sophomores or juniors who have had a course in
